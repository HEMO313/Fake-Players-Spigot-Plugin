# Fake Players (Spigot Plugin)
Fake Players is a Minecraft Spigot/Paper Spigot plugin, which allows server owners, administrators and developers to trick Spigot into thinking that there are new players logging in. This results in creating special Server-side bots, which can be used to test server's performance and other plugins.
